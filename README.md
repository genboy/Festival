( or download latest stable version [@ poggit https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/Festival](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/Festival) - no Festival menu, only command usage)

#### Get started

**Management UI in game**: 
command **hold magic item** or ** /fe menu** (ui, form, data)
( default magic item 201 - Purpur Pillar block - change in config management) 
When using the form you need to **use the magic item to tab area positions**.
You can swapp item to build/break during area position 1 and 2 selection.

Or use the commands as shown in the usage image (now with Multi wORd FULLY CapitAlized nameS possible) 

  **Create area** with **menu**:  
 
   You can use cmd '/fe menu' or just hold the magic item (purpur block/your selected item/block). 
    Then if you choose create area you should tab the positions with the magic item.  
    After tab pos1 you may use other blocks to build etc. and then hold the magic item again to tab pos2. Directly after tab pos2 the menu should come back to name your area.

 **Create area** with **commands**:  
    
   Use /fe pos1 and /fe pos2 to tab the positions, after pos2 you need '/fe create area ' to finnish the area creation. After creation both commands and menu can be used to manage the area.

      - leave; when a player leaves the area


    To add a command you need at least;
      - an areaname, 
      - an unique id for the command 
      - make sure the command works! (when you are op)
      
      
    /fe command <AREANAME> <add/list/edit/event*/del> <COMMANDID> <COMMANDSTRING/enter*/leave*/center*> 
 
	
   ##### Add a command:

	/fe command <AREANAME> add <COMMANDID> <COMMANDSTRING>

 	  'add' is the default for attaching a command on the 'enter' event. 
	  Using 'enter', 'center' or 'leave' instead of 'add' attaches the new command to 
	  the given eventtype: i.e. /fe command <areaname> center <commandid> <commandstring>

   ##### List area commands:
	
	/fe command <AREANAME> list
		
   ##### Edit command:
	
	/fe command <AREANAME> edit <COMMANDID> <COMMANDSTRING>

## Credits

### Many thanks to all who have posted valid issues and requests!

The basic area code in Festival derives from the [iProctector plugin](https://github.com/LDX-MCPE/iProtector). Credits for the basic area creation and protection code go to the iProtector creator [LDX-MCPE](https://github.com/LDX-MCPE) and [other iProtector devs](https://github.com/LDX-MCPE/iProtector/network). 

The Festival code is written and tested by [Genboy](https://www.genboy.net) and first released on 12 Feb 2018 with an area object holding events (enter and leave messages) and soon extended with functions and ingame commands to attach a commandstring to a area-event. Since v1.0.7 the area's and players can be protected with 12 flags, and trigger commands on areaEnter, areaCenter and areaLeave. And players can teleport to top-center of an area. 
In festival version 1.0.8 many flag functions where improved and the plugin was extended with 8 new flags, language translation options and area floating titles. During v1.0.9 to 2.1.0 many flag functions where improved, a compass-to-area option added and translations extended to en/nl/es/pl .
